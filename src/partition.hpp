/**
 * @brief Which links this rank owns, and where they sit in its local arrays.
 *
 * A rank owns a scattered set of global link indices, so `results` cannot be indexed
 * globally: at CONUS scale that would mean allocating the whole 99.7 GiB array on every
 * rank to use a fraction of it. Every rank therefore keeps a dense local index space
 * 0..n_owned-1, and this maps between the two.
 *
 * Local indices are assigned in increasing global order, so a single-rank run is the
 * identity map and behaves exactly as before.
