 * @brief Inverts the parent lists into the child/in-degree form the countdown needs.
 * Derived from node_map; no new input file.
 *
 * child[] is one index, not a list, because every link drains to exactly one downstream
 * link. Checked here rather than assumed: a link with two children would lose a release
 * and deadlock the traversal.
 *
 * @param setup The model setup containing the node map.
 * @return The dependency graph for the whole network.
